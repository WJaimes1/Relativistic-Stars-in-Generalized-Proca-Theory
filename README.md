# Relativistic-Stars-in-Generalized-Proca-Theory
This is a Python code which solves structure equations for a relativistic star with a polytropic EOS in the Generalized Proca Theory. 

There are two codes for each coupling, cubic and quartic. One of them solves the system of differential equations for 
the interior and the exterior of the star for a polytropic EOS with a well defined central pressure. The other one solves 
the set of differential equations only for the interior of the star for the same EOS but varying the central pressure.
